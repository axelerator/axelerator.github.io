In this episode I shared my hot code replace setup for Elm explorations with you. After struggling with the limitations of `elm reactor` I build this little boiler plate setup to shorten my feedback loop.

Here is the link to the ["coming from JavaScript of the official guide"](https://elm-lang.org/docs/from-javascript) showing the diffrences between Elm and JavaScript syntax.

If you want to use the boilerplate you can use the [`hot_elm`](https://github.com/axelerator/elm-nano-examples/tree/master/hot_elm) folder from my ["Elm nano examples"](https://github.com/axelerator/elm-nano-examples) directory.
Just execute the `./bin/build.sh` (or `./bin/build_linux`) in the project folder. It will listen to changes until you cancel it with `CTRL+C`

In the shell should look something like this:

```
--> ./bin/build.sh
Compiling ⚔️
Compiled without errors
^C
`--> 
```

You should then be able to open the `index.html` in the browser directly from disk and it will reload the Elm app and display build errors if present.

    <source src="/assets/posts/hotelmprev.mp4"
            type="video/mp4">

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support mp4 videos.
</video>

The main driver of the setup is a shell script that watches the source directory for changes and triggers a recompile if necessary.

{% include nano.html file="hot_elm/bin/build.sh" lang="elm" %}


The other part is a vanilla JavaScript file that keeps polling a file that is written on each build and contains a timestamp and potential error messages.


{% include nano.html file="hot_elm/assets/loader.js" lang="javascript" %}
