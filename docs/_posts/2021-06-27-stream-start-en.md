The only thing that's even more energy draining than reading long texts is writing them.
That's why I've decided to give the "stream format" a try.

The target audience are developers that have some experience with other languages and frameworks but are not entirely sure what all the fuzz around functional programming is about.

Last week I found a [fantastically explained Clojure implementation of Tetris](https://shaunlebron.github.io/t3tr0s-slides/) on HackerNews.

That inspired me to write a version in [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/). It took me only two evenings. The whole **process** was much more pleasing than evolving implementations in the languages I deal with at work.
And I want to use this opportunity to share this experience by reimplementing it live from scratch and streaming it.

For my [first little testrun on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/programmingisfun) (since I've never streamed anything) I built a *Hello World* app with [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).

In contrast to other frameworks the whole process only took 10 minutes because it doesn't need any additional build tools or dev servers.

The upcoming episodes are going to be a bit longer. For each episode I'll create a page here where I'll will share the recording and other recources like code examples.
