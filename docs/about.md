Hi ðŸ‘‹

<img src="/assets/axel-small.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Axel"/>

My name is Axel.

I like a lot of things, some about which I might write here on my blog.
I earn my living with software development since over twenty years and I still enjoy it.

Here on my blog I want to write specifically about things I enjoy in the hope that others might enjoy them as well.

If you're lokking to contact me, you can find me here
