If you’ve been eyeing functional programming or diving into Single Page
Application (SPA) development I think no other tool is better suited for you than
<a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. It stands out as a language that not only makes development
delightful but also serves as the perfect gateway to the world of functional
programming.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="statically-typed-bliss">Statically Typed Bliss</h2>

<p>One of Elm’s key charms is, believe it or not, its static typing, a game-changer when compared to
JavaScript. The compiler acts as your trusty sidekick, catching errors before
they wreak havoc at runtime. What sets Elm apart is not just the typing but the
incredible clarity of compiler messages.</p>

<p>Elm isn’t just another functional language; it’s a dedicated tool for building
SPAs. 
If you think in “React terms” it combines</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>TypeScript</em> (language)</li>
  <li><em>NPM</em> (package manager)</li>
  <li><em>React</em> (rendering)</li>
  <li><em>Redux</em> (state management)</li>
</ul>

<p>all in <strong>one single</strong> tool.</p>

<p><label for="def-haskell" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="def-haskell" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote">
<a href="https://www.haskell.org">
<img src="/assets/posts/a-tour-of-elm/haskell-logo.svg" style="width: 35%" alt="Haskell logo" /></a>
was created as a research langugage and as such was explicitly designed
to contain experimental features and syntax.<br />
That leads to many different “styles” which make it hard to learn fast.
</span></p>

<p>The focus on a single target platform (the browser) allows Elm to be simpler than its
general-purpose functional counterparts like 
<a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to other languages offering functional features <em>additionally</em> to imperative and/or object oriented patters,
<label for="def-imperative" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="def-imperative" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote">
Lanugages like Ruby and JavaScript also <em>allow</em> but don’t enforce
the functional style. Leading to the majority of code in these languages
being in imperative.
</span></p>

<p>Elm stands out by staying true to the functional programming style throughout.
This makes it an ideal candidate for developers who are already familiar with more 
conventional programming languages and want to focus on learning the <strong>functional approach</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<p>Elm’s elegance lies in its simplicity. It is a comparatively <em>small</em> language. Concretely
that means there are <em>less keywords</em> and less <em>concepts</em> (no object orientation).
That results just in general in <em>less ways to achieve the same thing</em>.</p>

<p>Of course this comes at a cost and there are certain <em>“meta concepts”</em> that cannot be abstracted
away as <em>elegantly</em> as in for example Haskell (Elm has no type classes for example).</p>

<p>But in return it is just easier to learn “the whole” language than other languages like 
<label for="def-ts" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="def-ts" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="marginnote">
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">
    <img src="/assets/posts/a-tour-of-elm/ts.svg" style="width: 15%" alt="TspeScript logo" />
</a><br />
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript’s</a>
claim is “TypeScript” is JavaScript with syntax for types.
So you have to master JavaScript and then <strong>learn some more</strong> to benefit from
the additional features of TypeScript.
</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"><em>TypeScript</em></a>.</p>

<p>I do believe that “frontend code” should stay <em>simple and stupid</em>. Especially in web apps
most of the complicated number wrangling should be done in the backend anyway. And there you
are free to use any language you want.</p>

<p>(I do think the idea that having the same language is highly overrated, but that topic makes
for a complete separate blog post).</p>

<h2 id="instant-gratification">Instant gratification</h2>

<p>Another reason why I love to protoype experiments in Elm is that it easy to produce something
anyone can interact with. 
The usual way to learn general purpose languages is to start with command line applications,
which are not accessible to regular users.
By targeting the browser you can create something that’s <a href="https://elm-visualization.netlify.app/weatherradial/">colorful</a> 
and/or <a href="https://elm-lang.org/examples/mario">interactive</a>
with only a few lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="a-tour-of-elm">A Tour of Elm</h2>

<p>I’m thrilled to share “A Tour of Elm,” a beginner course tailored for those
with no prior experience in functional programming or SPAs. In this
journey, we’ll first quickly go over with the basics, covering essential concepts
like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lay the foundation for SPA development. The
course seamlessly progresses with interactive lessons, providing a hands-on Elm
experience in digestible portions. What’s even better? You can dive right in
without the hassle of installing any software – it’s all accessible directly in
your browser.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Elm isn’t just a language; it’s a delightful experience waiting to be explored. 
Whether you’re new to functional programming or eager to master SPAs, Elm’s
simplicity and focus make it the perfect companion. Embrace the joy of coding
with Elm today!</p>
